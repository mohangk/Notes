SRP - do only one thing. Change one place
Open close - Open for extension but close for modification
Liskov substitution  - Replace instance of parent with child without creating any unexpected or incorrect behaviour. Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
Interface segregation principle - Interfaces should be granular enough that no class that implements it will be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
Dependency inversion principle -  pass in dependencies as opposed to hard coding it. Allows for new behaviour to be introduced without modifying the code. Abstractions should not depend on the details, details should depend on abstractions.
