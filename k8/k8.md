- deploy the same k8 cluster to a private gke and expose the service with an network LB

- figure out how we configure amount of CPU, pods etc
- can we allocate certain ip ranges to a particular deployment
- ~~figure out how the redis master-slave is setup~~
- try to expose it over a NEG
- try to understand what nginx-ingress does

#### Networking in docker-compose

Automatically sets up networking between docker instances, based on the service name


### Minikube

1. Installing mikube: from the guide <http://blog.programmableproduction.com/2018/03/08/Archlinux-Setup-Minikube-using-KVM/

2. Re-using docker from minikube 

   eval $(minikube docker-env)



#### Starting minikube

sudo systemctl start libvirtd.service
sudo systemctl start virtlogd.service
minikube start --vm-driver kvm2

#### Questions

1. How many networks does minikube setup?



### kubernetes architecture

#### master

- api server
  - scheduler
  - controller manager

#### (worker) nodes

- kubelet (watches and manages processes on a particular node)
- kube-proxy (glue that allows networking from outside the node access services exposed on the node)

#### pods

Containers in a Pod run on a “logical host”; they use the same network namespace (in other words, the same IP address and port space), and the same IPC namespace. They can also use shared volumes. These properties make it possible for these containers to efficiently communicate, ensuring data locality. Also, Pods enable you to manage several tightly coupled application containers as a single unit. Can communicate via

- shared volumes
- IPC
- local network (share a common host)

#### health check

##### readiness probe

- when a container is ready to servce traffic. removed from loadbalancer if this fails

##### liveliness probe

- kubelet uses this to decide when to restart a container



### k8 replicas
####  replicaset

 	1. set in your deployment.yml - replicas in the yaml file
 	2. kubect scale
     - kubectl scale --replicas=x deployment/<deployment-name>
	3. Exposing the new pods
    - kubectl expose 

- bare pods

- job

- daemonset

  #### native storage options

Kubernetes natively offers some solutions to manage storage: ephemeral options, persistent storage in terms of Persistent Volumes,  Persistent Volume Claims, Storage Classes, or StatefulSets.
