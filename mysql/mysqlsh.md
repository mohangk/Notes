### mysqlshell

#### Available at

* [MySQL :: Download MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/)
* Github - [GitHub - mysql/mysql-shell: MySQL Shell is a new command line scriptable shell for MySQL. It supports JavaScript and Python.](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-shell)

#### Basics

* Establish connection
./mysqlsh user@server/database
* Run SQL inline once started shell
/sql

#### Data dump and restore

###### util.dumpData

* gtid is available in the @.json file in the dump

###### util.loadData

###### Disabling binary logs during data load

Start mysql without bin-log enabled to ensure you dont have to deal with growing binary logs sizes when doing a restore. Sometimes you can't do this within the shell due to the user so you have to do it in the config

```
[mysqld]
skip-log-bin
```

On CloudSQL the binary logs can be disabled like so

gcloud sql instances patch dest-db-57 --no-enable-bin-log

###### Increase the lock\_wait\_timeout

so that parallel loads into the same table dont end up just dying

\-\- need to figure out if there is a better way to do this with mysqlsh?

###### innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode

Set it to 2 if using BINLOG\_FORMAT=ROW
We recommend setting it to 2 when the BINLOG\_FORMAT=ROW. With interleaved, INSERT statements don’t use the table-level AUTO-INC lock and multiple statements can execute at the same time. Setting it to 0 or 1 can cause a huge hit in concurrency for certain workloads.

Interleaved (or 2) is the fastest and most scalable lock mode, but it is not safe if using STATEMENT-based replication or recovery scenarios when SQL statements are replayed from the binary log. Another consideration – which you shouldn’t rely on anyway – is that IDs might not be consecutive with a lock mode of 2. That means you could do three inserts and expect IDs 100,101 and 103, but end up with 100, 102 and 104. For most people, this isn’t a huge deal.
