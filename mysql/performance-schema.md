#### Performance Shema and Sys schema

1. Provides a way to determine where the database is spending the most time

2. Tables that are of interest
* events_statements_current - replacement for SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST
* events_statements_summary_by_digest - statistics about classes of queries over time
* events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name: 
    *  has aggregate data for wait events grouped by the event name
* table_io_waits_summary_by_table: 
    *  related to the wait/io/table/sql/handler in the events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name table. These provide information about the amount of time spent per table split by the time spent for reads, writes, fetch, insert, update, or delete.
* file_summary_by_instance: 
    * shows how much time is spent on actual file I/O and how much data is accessed. very useful for determining where time is spent doing disk I/O and which files have the most data accesses on disk.
