### Remaking Medusa

timezones kills you and your team, multiple offices kills you
need a vision,  a calling, a fight that can bind different groups together. challenges around culture, expectations, org hierarchy

technical challenges are real, but you will be killed by the organizational challenges long before the technical ones do you in

change needs to be ground up, but it needs to be nurtured top down

#### dont get fucked in a deal by not doing a due diligence 
- your bosses will want to run as fast as possible
- they will want you to agree with everything as soon as possible
- they will say “the deal will get done anyway” ==> tell them they could realistically be wasting all their money

####  as long as the team isn’t killing themselves and each other, they will learn more then they have ever 
- the best engineers are grown from the worst projects — as long as the reason the project is bad has nothing to do with the team

— 

- what do you think is our single biggest challenge?
- what do you think we should be doing different?
- how do we get teams working better with each other?
- how do we increase the knowledge and make it easier for teams to work on common shared components?
