Acquiring wisdom is a moral duty as well as a practical one

Learn to fluency the big multidisciplinary ideas of the world and use them regularly. 

Learn to think through problems backwards as well as forward.

Be reliable. Unreliability can cancel out the other virtues

Avoid intense ideologies. Always consider the other side as carefully as your own

At the same time, allow for the self-serving bias in others who haven’t removed it.

Work with and under people you admire, and avoid the inverse when at all possible.

Learn to maintain your objectivity, especially when it’s hardest.

Concentrate experience and power into the hands of the right people – the wise learning machines. 

You’ll be most successful where you’re most intensely interested.

Learn the all-important concept of assiduity: Sit down and do it until it’s done.

Use setbacks in life as an opportunity to become a bigger and better person. Don’t wallow.

The highest reach of civilization is a seamless system of trust among all parties concerned.
