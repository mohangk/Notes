##### [Chapter 2: Money, Credit and Economic Activity](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/money-credit-debt-ray-dalio/)

Money and credit - are associated with wealth, they are not wealth.  To create more wealth - one has to be more productive.  Short term debt cycles happen when the regulation between the amount of credit by the federal bank is not perfect, drives inflation.  

Real economy - the actual transactions that happen in the world. The Financial economy the supply and demand of money. As far as how the economic machine works, the big thing is that **money and credit is stimulative when it’s given out and depressing when it has to be paid back.  That’s what normally makes money, credit, and economic growth so cyclical.**

The short-term cycles of ups and downs typically last about eight years, give or take a few.  The timing is determined by the amount of time it takes the stimulant to raise demand to the point that it reaches the limits of the real economy’s capacity to produce.  Most people have seen enough of these short-term debt cycles to know what they are like—so much so that they mistakenly think that they will go on working this way forever.  They’re most popularly called “the business cycle,” though I call them “the short-term debt cycle” to distinguish them from “the long-term debt cycle.”  Over long periods of time these short-term debt cycles add up to long-term debt cycles that typically last about 50 to 75 years.[[2]](http://applewebdata//0735D399-574C-4BD8-BA3B-73C467DAEFCE#_ftn2) Because they come along about once in a lifetime most people aren’t aware of them; as a result they typically take people by surprise, which hurts a lot of people.

###### Appendix to Chapter 2

Dollar, yen euro and in te late stages of their long-term debt cycles - debts are high, real interest rates are low, lots of new debt being created in these currencies. Loss of reserve currency status will leade to huge economic disruptions

There is a real economy and there is a financial economy. Financial economy has its own supply and demand - printing of money etc. Debt and bonds also can devalue and die through printing of money.

Levers for dealing with debt & debt-service levels in:

- Austerity

- Debt default and restructurings

- Raise taxes

- Print money and devalue it

Printing money most expedient, least understood way of dealing with this issue.

Most people are not aware of currency risk (devaluation) as they are aware of other type of asset risk.  What does currency devalue against? Debt. When debt helps companies be more productive, stock prices go up and that is good. When it hurts the interest rates (returns on cash) it drives investment into other inflation hedged assets. 

Late debt cycle breakdown - when debts are so height that the entire currency needs to be wiped out to rest things.

World War 1 began in 1914 and countries had to take on a lot of debt to finance the war. Later the losers were burdened with so much debt repayments that their economies and currencies were destroyed. E.g. Weimar Republic Germany. During wars countries don't trust currency, they use gold or silver. In 1971 Nixon ended Bretton Woods leaving the gold standard.

History has shown that there is a high risk in  holding interest-earning cash as a store-hold of wealth late in the debt cycle

#### [Big cycles over the last 500 years](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycles-over-last-500-years-ray-dalio/)

Key attributes to measure when comparing empires

- Education, invention and technology, competitiveness, military might, higher output and trade, financial centre, reserve currency 

The typical stages of a big cycle behind empire rises and declines

- new world order

- peace, prosperity and productive debt growth

- debt bubble and big wealth gap

- debt bust and economic down turn

- printing money and credit

- revolutions and wars 

- debt and political restructuring

- New world order 

1500-1600 - China was strongest empire in the East and Spain in the West. Then Holland (Netherlands) took over, hitting its peak in 1650 and declining in 1780. After that the Dutch lost their competitiveness and started loosing ground to the British.  The lost of competitiveness could be attributed to a lot of internal fighting - between Dutch states, between rich & poor, weakened military.

There were lots of fighting between the Dutch and the British - Anglo - Dutch wars. France also started to assert itself. In the end the Dutch lost, got into lots of Debt and their currency the guilder started to loose prominence. 

"**The Dutch and British had lots of conflicts over economic issues.**  For example, the English made a law that only English ships could be used to import goods into England, which hurt Dutch shipping companies that had a big business of shipping others’ goods to England, which led to the English seizing Dutch ships and expanding the British East India Company.  Typically before all-out war is declared there is about a decade of these sorts of economic, technological, geopolitical, and capital wars when the conflicting powers approach comparability and test and try to intimidate each other’s powers.  At the time the British came up with military inventions and built more naval strength, and they continued to gain relative economic strength."

Similarly Britain then had internal issues, became inefficient and started loosing out to Britain. World War 1 also brought lots of damage.  WW1 - 1914-1918, 8.5 million soldiers, 13.5 million civilians .Towards the end Spanish flu wiped out between 20-15million people. 1914-1920 was a horrible time.

1920s - were a period of growth - roaring 20s - US, Victorian age in Britain, crazy period in France, even Germany  was restored. "The social and cultural features known as the Roaring Twenties began in leading metropolitan centers and spread widely in the [aftermath of World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_I "Aftermath of World War I"). The United States gained dominance in world finance. Thus, when [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic") could no longer afford to pay [World War I reparations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_reparations "World War I reparations") to the United Kingdom, France, and the other Allied powers, the United States came up with the [Dawes Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawes_Plan "Dawes Plan"), named after banker and later 30th [Vice President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States "Vice President of the United States") [Charles G. Dawes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_G._Dawes "Charles G. Dawes"). [Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street "Wall Street") invested heavily in Germany, which paid its reparations to countries that, in turn, used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington. By the middle of the decade, prosperity was widespread, with the second half of the decade known, especially in Germany, as the "[Golden Twenties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Twenties "Golden Twenties")".[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring_Twenties#cite_note-12)"

 While 1939 and 1941 are known as the official start of the wars in Europe and the Pacific, the wars really started about 10 years before that, as economic conflicts that were at first limited progressively grew into World War II.  As Germany and Japan became more expansionist economic and military powers..
